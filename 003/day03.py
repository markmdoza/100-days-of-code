# Angela's solution
# Which number do you want to check?
# number = int(input())

# If the number can be divided by 2 with 0 remainder.
# if number % 2 == 0:
#   print("This is an even number.")
# Otherwise (number cannot be divided by 2 with 0 remainder).
# else:
#   print("This is an odd number.")
